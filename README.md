Description
-----------

[Vecni] is a light-weight PHP micro-framework that utilizes url dispatching to server files instead of
filesystem url resolution. It utilizes Twig, which is equivalent to Python Jinja2 templates for advance template
management.

The aim of [Vecni] is to allow fast development and separate developers and designers task from each other
without bombarding them with tones of tools which they may not need.
In addition, [Vecni] is about the developers, who want to do most of coding, but have unique tools and functions
to aid in development. For instance, [Vecni] uses advance namespaces and autoloading tools to access modules from anywhere, which is much like python or C++ package management.

There is no installation, everything works right out of the box once you've downloaded the modules you need for development.

Getting Started
---------------

[Vecni] uses a number of components such as [Twig] for templating, [Less] for css pre-processing
amongst others that will be mentioned in the Tech Stack section.

In the root folder of the application, run the following git commands:

    $ git submodule update --init

This will perform a git clone on external modules that are needed.

Database Configuration
----------------------

In the etc/configs folder there is a settings.ini.php file which contains basic server configuration.
You can add your database settings or any settings you need to be rendered globally.


Apache Configuration
--------------------
In order for the application to use url dispatching, one must enable the rewrite module in apache.

[Click here to enable rewrite module for Linux].
[Click here to enable rewrite module for Windows].

Enabling apache rewrite module allows [Vecni] to be used at full capacity, where by
all request to the [Vecni] base application is have to be validated via the index page. This will disallow direct
POST and GET requests to files and folders.
